##### The app might not work properly in Firefox because of the CORS. If this is the case, try opening in Chrome or other browsers instead.  

## Overview

The application is a mini reddit client that fetches and displays 26 most popular posts from Reddit on the initial load of the page. 
A user can search reddit for a specific post or filter posts by categories.

Toggle dark/light mode is also available.

## API features

Since an undocumented **Reddit JSON API** (https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/JSON) was used for this project, there are a couple of things to note:
- You can view posts and comments of other users but can't create your own because only GET requests are allowed by this API.
- Some graphic objects (like pictures from reddit gallery or embedded images/videos etc) can not be displayed in posts due to limitations. In these cases a link to the official website is displayed in the post.
